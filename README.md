# timestamp-using-node
Ths repository contains codes for the project which I created to complete  freecodedcamp projects. 
You can enter date in two formats and this timestamp will display the time in milliseconds from epoch and also the UTC format time.

1. Enter it in YYYY-MM-HH for e.g. 2017-11-23

2. Enter it in milliseconds for e.g. 1450137600000
